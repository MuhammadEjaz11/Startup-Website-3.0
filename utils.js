Unlike simply uploading a graphic file, digitizing requires a skilled technician called a digitizer to recreate the design using a specialized embroidery software. The process involves assigning stitch types, directions, lengths, and densities to different parts of the design. Each element whether it's a small detail in a logo or the background fill—must be manually programmed to ensure the machine sews it correctly. This process transforms your flat image into a stitch-ready file, typically in formats like DST, PES, EXP, or JEF depending on the machine being used.",

Unlike pixel-based images (like JPEGs or PNGs), vector files are made up of paths defined by mathematical formulas—allowing them to be resized without losing clarity or quality. This process is essential for screen printing, engraving, laser cutting, and high-resolution printing. A skilled vector artist carefully redraws the artwork using tools to define precise lines, curves, and color separations. Every shape and detail is recreated manually, ensuring the final vector file is crisp, professional, and print-ready. Vector files are typically saved in formats like AI, EPS, SVG, or PDF, depending on the intended use and production method.
